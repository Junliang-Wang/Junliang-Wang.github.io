In life, I follow one lemma: Do things that makes myself proud.

It's not about being better than others. Rather, you want to admire yourself.
All achievements are relatives--_e.g.,_ raising a child, running 10 km, selling a painting or losing 10 kg--and we must celebrate them! 

This is why, I list below some of my personal achievements that I feel really proud of.
