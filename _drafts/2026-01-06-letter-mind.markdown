Dear Mind,

Last year I wrote a [letter to our body]({% post_url 2024-12-23-letter-body %}). 
This time, it's just for you.


On paper, **2025 has been a year full of accomplishments**: we cycled more than 1,300 km from Sydney to Melbourne, we [ran 100 miles]({% post_url 2025-11-15-gpt100 %}) over 33 hours without sleep, we published [not only one](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09827-w) but [two *Nature*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09139-z) papers, and we significantly improved our dancing skills.
I know you are proud of us.
**But again, that's on paper.**

You saw my struggles.
You heard my thoughts.
You felt my emptiness.

"Why do you feel that you're still not good enough?" you asked.
"Who are you really trying to prove your worth to?"

You forced me to slow down and have honest conversations with you.
You helped me realize that **I was chasing overwhelming goals to avoid facing my real worries.**
You guided me to discover my deepest fear and share my flaws.
You gave me courage to seek help and show vulnerability.

As you already know, I felt deeply guilty every time I complained about my life.
**How can I possibly have complaints?**
Me, financially privileged and in good health?
Me, surrounded by people who genuinely care about me?

And yet, I do.

You reminded me that **being human means being imperfect, and that's allowed.**
The people who truly care about me won’t walk away because of my flaws.

**My dear Mind, you're my closest friend.**
You have always been with me, celebrating my small victories, sharing quiet moments of gratitude, listening to my complaints, and cheering me up in my darkest moments.

Without you, I would never be complete.
**Without you, I would have felt truly alone.**
Without you, I would have collapsed a thousand and one times.

Thank you for staying with me this year, and for all the years before.
**Let's keep growing together.**
There is still so much left to discover!
