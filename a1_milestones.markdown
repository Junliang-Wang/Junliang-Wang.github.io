In life, I follow one simple motto: **Do things that make me proud**.

It's not about being better than others.
Rather, I want to **earn my own respect** and keep challenging my beliefs.
Plus, I feel most fulfilled when my journey **inspires others** to become a better version of themselves.

**All achievements are relative**: raising a child, running 10 km, selling a painting, or losing 5 kg.
We must **celebrate them all**!

I’ve listed below some of **my personal achievements** that I feel genuinely proud of.
