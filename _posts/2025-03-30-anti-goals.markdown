Recently at work, we had a session about high-performing teams.
A question came up: **_What drives you?_**
This is a powerful question, and we often forget to ask ourselves this.
Now, this is your chance: stop reading and note down a few answers.

Later on, when my brain was wandering randomly, it did something interesting: it flipped the question around.
**_What doesn't drive me?_**
Despite being so similar, the answers have completely different ramifications.
We seldom solely focus on what we want.
However, it's equally (or even more) important to stand for things that we want to avoid--**things that we must not compromise on**.
In the end, what are the "goals" that, if I achieve them, will make me miserable?

Immediately, what comes to mind is: being a great liar.
Not being trustworthy is the complete opposite of what would make me proud.
Therefore, I simply have to be honest even if it means having tough conversations.

Here's another one: all talk, no action.
I absolutely hate to justify to someone why I abandoned a personal goal--especially if I talked about it with passion, but took no real action.
Apart from getting disappointed in myself, I feel that I let the other person down.
I put their trust in jeopardy, because next time when I talk about my ambitions, it would be all empty words.
The solution? I try to keep my mouth shut, and let the results speak for themselves.

Everyone is different, and the beauty of life is to discover your goals and "anti-goals".
It's equally important to **know what you want and what you don't want**.
Pay close attention to experiences that don't drive you.
Eliminate or avoid them in the future.
Refresh the mental model of yourself.
Do not compromise.
Take action.
Enjoy the journey.
