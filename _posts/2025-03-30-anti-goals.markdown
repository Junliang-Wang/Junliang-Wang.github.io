</div>

Recently at work, we had a session about high-performing teams.
A question came up: _**What drives you?**_
This is a powerful question, and we often forget to ask ourselves.
So, now it's your chance: stop reading and reflect for a minute on your own answers.

Later that same day, my brain did something interesting--it flipped the question around:
_**What doesn't drive me?**_
To be honest, it felt like a tiny revelation.

Despite the question being so similar, the answers lead to completely different insights.
We often focus solely on what we want.
However, it's equally (or even more) important to stand for the things we want to avoid--the things we must never compromise on.
In the end, what are the "goals" that, if we achieve them, would actually make us miserable?

Personllay, one thing that comes immediately to my mind is: being a great liar.
Not being trustworthy is the complete opposite of what would make me proud.
Therefore, I simply have to be honest, even if it means having tough conversations.

Here's another one: all talk, no action.
I absolutely hate having to justify to someone why I abandoned a personal goal--especially if I spoke about it with passion but took no real action.
Apart from being disappointed in myself, I feel that I've let the other person down.
I put their trust in jeopardy.
The next time I talk about my ambitions, it might sound like empty words to them.
The solution? I try to keep my mouth shut and let the results speak for themselves.

Everyone is different, and the beauty of life is discovering both your goals and your "anti-goals".
It's equally important to be aware of **what you want and what you don't want**.
Pay close attention to experiences that don't drive you.
Eliminate or avoid them in the future.
Refresh your mental model of yourself.
Do not compromise.
Take action.
Enjoy the journey.
