**Books are by far the best investment you can make.**
Period.
That's why, I felt extremely lucky every time I find one that **_radically_ changes my understanding** on any topic.
Therefore, I want to share with you **my 6 favorite eye-opening books** (not in a particular order).

    Rich dad, poor dad
  </div>
  <div class="book-author">
    by Robert Kiyosaki
  </div>
</div>

I start this list with the book that I have gifted the most.
In my humble opinion, it is **the best introduction to personal finance**.
Is pension your retirement plan?
Or do you think that buying stocks is gambling?
If so, then you were like me before reading this book.
The story told by Robert Kiyosaki is not only extremely easy to follow, but it can completely shatter **your understanding of money**.
After being exposed to concepts such as assets, liabilities, or compound interest, **I felt embarrassed by how financially illiterate I was**.
But that's ok.
It's never too late to start the journey towards **financial independence**.

    The 4-hour workweek
  </div>
  <div class="book-author">
    by Tim Ferriss
  </div>
</div>

If you don't know who is Tim Ferriss, you are in luck because he has a lot of **productivity content** that you will enjoy (like his [podcast](https://tim.blog/podcast/)!).
This book in particular opened my eyes to **our relationship with work**.
Do you believe me if I tell you that **by working less you can produce more**?
The answer is yes, but the real question is how.
Although many step-by-step examples described in the book are outdated, the key principles are timeless.
You are not going to regret this read.

    Born to run
  </div>
  <div class="book-author">
    by Christopher McDougall
  </div>
</div>

I am sure you think that humans are not built for running.
In term of speed, we are awfully slow.
But what if I tell you that our anatomy says otherwise?
If you were skeptical like me, this book will change your mind.
**[Spoiler alert: we are the best animal at long-distance running.]** The good news is, this is far from being a technical book.
Christopher McDougall tells his personal experience with **a hidden tribe** in the Copper Canyon (Mexico) called Tarahumara.
FYI, their members can run easily 50 km per day… in the mountains… and with just sandals!
**You don't need to be a runner to enjoy** this gem, but I am sure that after finishing it, you will have the urge to go out jogging!
Look at me, it made me to fall in love with trail running.

    How to avoid a climate disaster
  </div>
  <div class="book-author">
    by Bill Gates
  </div>
</div>

Climate change is a real issue.
Period.
Not only this book is **easily accessible for the general public**, but it contains specific quantities to give the reader a frame of reference.
For example, did you know that for each ton of cement produced a ton of CO2 equivalent is emitted?
I wasn't expecting that much!
After walking through the most polluting sectors in terms of greenhouse emissions, Bill Gates emphasizes reiteratively the main message: we must **achieve zero emissions by 2050**.
Although this may provoke anxiety, **there is hope**.
There are a large number of startups with brilliant ideas racing to solve thousand and one climate challenges.
So, this book may make you reorient your career.

    Outlive
  </div>
  <div class="book-author">
    by Peter Attia
  </div>
</div>

What's the **modern medicine** about?
It's about treatments.
You go to a doctor when you have symptoms such as pain, cancer or obesity.
If you stop and think about it, you will realize that in most cases the problems came from long before: lack of exercise, excess alcohol or poor diet.
Petter Attia left his oncology career for the science of longevity.
In simpler words, he focuses on how to prevent symptoms to appear by **playing the long-term game in life**.
Don't be scared off by the deep dives into the technical details, the core concepts are invaluable.
Few examples of my favorite ones are the ideal of the marginal decade, how to screen for colon cancer, the centennial decathlon, or the relation between stability and longevity.
Without a doubt, this reading will make you **reconsider your lifestyle**.

    Models

  <div class="book-author">
    by Mark Manson

You may find strange that **a dating book** made it onto this list (so do I).
No worries, it isn't about tactics or stupid pickup lines.
For me, it's a hidden gem about the **psychology of attraction**.
This book is a perfect reminder to keep building your own identity, not being needy and standing up for your core values.
You will be surprised at the benefit of being vulnerable and clearly communicating your intentions from the start.
Although it focuses on dating, I find some of the core concepts directly applicable to **any personal relationship**, from professional networking to long-term friendships.
As icing on the cake, **it's quite funny!**
