People collect coins and antiques; **I collect quotes**.
A few well-chosen words can contain a book-worth of knowledge. 
How powerful is that? 
To me, **quotes are simply pocket-sized life lessons!** 
And the best ones do not even need context!

Here are **four of my all-time favorite quotes**, brief yet powerful:

<div class="quote-container">
  <div class="quote">
    Ask big questions
  </div>
  <div class="quote-author">
    — Jack Szostak
  </div>
</div>

This is the advice that Nobel Prize laureate Jack Szostak gave to his young student Jennifer Doudna.
It led her to pioneer gene-editing research and eventually win her own Nobel Prize.
This three-word advice is **my favorite reminder to dream big**.
We have limited time and energy, and we tend to spend them on irrelevant tasks.
Only by asking big questions I was able to **laser-focus on impactful problems that truly excite me**.

<div class="quote-container">
  <div class="quote">
    One day or day one
  </div>
  <div class="quote-author">
    — Paulo Coelho
  </div>
</div>

The order of words really matters!
People often talk too much and take too little action.
Even the most talented individual needs to put in the hard work.
“One day I will do this” are just empty words.
Create your “day one” by taking action.
**Swap the words, and your mindset will follow along**.
Start by showing up.

  <div class="quote">
    Why bother?
  </div>
  <div class="quote-author">
    — Michael Pollan
  </div>
</div>

In his [original article](https://michaelpollan.com/articles-archive/why-bother/), this question was asked in the context of climate change. 
However, I find it extremely handy for countless other situations. 
For example, whenever I get annoyed, I ponder whether it is worth getting angry. 
Alternatively, when I feel really tired after long workouts, this quote reminds me why I care about training. 
This question helps me to **choose my battles wisely, and act when it truly matters**.

  <div class="quote">
    Less is more
  </div>
  <div class="quote-author">
    — Ludwig Mies van der Rohe
  </div>
</div>

Like his buildings, this quote is as minimalist as it can get.
If you can simplify something, change it.
If you can finish a task in less time, do it.
Focus on few goals.
Reduce material possessions.
Talk less, listen more.
Slow down to go fast.
Use common words for complex ideas.
**Pursue simplicity and efficiency** rather than quantity.
Less is more.
