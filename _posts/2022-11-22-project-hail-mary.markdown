Let me share with you one of the best sci-fi book I read this year!

I bet you have heard about [The Martian](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18007564-the-martian): the surviving chronicle of a lost human in the red planet.
If not, you are doubly lucky because two amazing interstellar journeys are waiting for you.

(Whisper threat) Don’t watch the movie.
Read the book!

The same author, Andy Weir, has another hidden gem (maybe not so hidden) called [Project Hail Mary](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54493401-project-hail-mary).
Although you can read the official sinopsis, let me simply say that (not a spoiler) the story starts with a man waking up in a spaceship, alone, and not remembering anything.
Where is he? Why is he there? What is the Project Hail Mary? 

With such a plot, I was immediately hooked up from the start (you will as well, I know).
Then, the narrative gets even better.
While you get to know (and bond with) the mysterious individual, the author slowly introduces to you fascinating concepts such as Astrophage, Taumoeba or Eridians (cool names, eh?).
On top of that, there is a beautiful development on the topic: if we find an extraterrestrial life (or alien if you prefer), how can we communicate with each other?

Although I am dying to discuss about all the incredible details in the book, I will let you enjoy the process of discovering them.
However, let me mention what I love about Andy’s writing style.
As in The Martian, the author tries to be as scientifically accurate as possible.
For instance, the exact time dilation is taken into account when traveling at near the speed of light.
Now, add on top random sparks of humor which soften whatever the tense situation the character is facing at.
And there you go, a perfectly balanced interstellar journey.

I laughed, surprised, suffered and even cried (yes, it gets quite emotional) while reading the book.
I hope you will find it delightful as well.

Finally, I discovered this gem from the [blog of Bill Gates](https://www.gatesnotes.com/books/project-hail-mary), along with many other great recommendations! Have a look if you are thirsty of new readings!
