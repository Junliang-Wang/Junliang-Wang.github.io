I am a big fan of riddles, especially those which are extremely simple to explain while having an elegant solution.
So, here it is one of my favorites! 

Imagine I give you a chessboard with its classical 8×8 squares, but without the top left and bottom right corners (see image below).

**Question: can you fill the entire board with pieces of dominoes?**
Note: each domino occupies two adjacent squares, so diagonals are not allowed.

More than 15 years ago, when I was a naïve young teenager, I discovered this riddle in the book [Fermat’s last theorem](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/950259.Fermat_s_Last_Theorem) by Simon Singh (I highly recommend it!).
This problem was an example of a mathematical proof without using brute force.
The simplicity of the solution just blew my mind.
Since then, I became an amateur riddle collector.
I hope you also enjoy solving this little problem!
