First of all, for those who don’t know me well, I am a **productivity nerd**. 
I love data, simple habits and analyze myself. 
Since we entered the new year recently, today’s post is about the question: **“How was my last year?”**.

I am sure that you also belong to the club that says **“time flies”**. 
I don’t know how, but I find myself always “busy”. 
However, when I tried to remember what I did, my mind usually goes blank (maybe I should check for Alzheimer symptoms!). 
Jokes aside, it’s frustrating!

I wanted to get rid of this blurry vision and have **a clear view of my days**. 
But, how? Allow me to jump directly to my solution: **A year in pixels!**

</div>


So, what is it? Few may say it’s **a simplified diary**; others, **a rating system**.
For me, it’s **a productivity hack to know myself better**.

The **colors** in this calendar represents the **quality of that day**. 
Most of the days are **neutral (yellow)**. 
It’s not surprising because none of us can be happy all the time. 
Although I had few unavoidable bad, frustrating or **depressing days (orange)**, great and **fulfilling days (blue)** are plenty, and scattered over the whole year!

In a simple glance, I see immediately that 2023 was a great year! I was active, and gathered great moments. 
But the analysis doesn’t stop here. 
**What if I tell you that you can go back to each day and find out the “why”?**

The **secret ingredient** is the **table-like diary** behind. 
The calendar is simply a visual representation of it. 
Let me show you an extract of it.

</div>

You can see why my Monday was neutral. 
Apart from work, I focused mainly on fixing things at home. 
Nothing really exciting. 
In the contrary, Saturday was great because I spent the day out in nature with friends, shared a nice lunch together, and enjoyed an interesting documentary. 
Simple, but fulfilling!

I don’t stop here. 
Now it’s the moment to **take further action**! 
Inspired by the idea of [Past Year Review](https://tim.blog/2021/12/27/past-year-review/) of Tim Ferriss, I identify my positive experiences in this table, and then, I force myself to **allocate quality time in advance** in my “busy” schedule. 
I cannot let meaningless appointments fill my agenda first! 
*Et voilà*, excited future events, here I come!

This sounds all nice, but… this surely takes too much time, right? 
The answer may surprise you… **Just 2 min per day!**

According to the best-seller book *Atomic Habits*, **when a habit is so easy to do, there is no reason not do it.** 
I designed this diary to be effortless to fill, and even enjoyable! 
Here it’s what you have to do **to set it up:**

1. **Choose an digital notebook** (accessible online and offline)
  * Objective: access at any time.
  * FYI: I use OneNote.
2. **Install it on all your electronics** (phone, laptop, tablet…)
  * Objective: access at anywhere.
  * Hack: place the notebook shortcut visible (e.g., bottom right corner of your phone apps if you are right handed).
3. **Prepare in advance the table** with dates for each month.
  * Hack: create the table in excel which fills the dates for you, and copy it over to OneNote
4. **Choose your color coding and rating**
  * Be creative, and adapt it for you!
  * Here it’s mine:

    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="{{ '/assets/images/posts/2024-01-21-a-year-in-pixels/diary_3_rating.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Example of ratings" style="width: 50%;">
    </div>

5. **At the end of each day...** (spend less than 2 minutes!)
  * ...rate your day, and
  * ...write a concise summary: only key facts and associated emotions.
  * Hack 1: maximum 3-4 lines.
  * Hack 2: it doesn’t need to be grammatically correct; if you understand, it does the job!
  * Example: “Clean house. Tennis at Glebe with Sergi, Laura and Filippo (fun!). Birthday dinner at Chaco Bar (really good and fun night!).”

6. **That’s all!**

At the beginning you may forget to do it every day. 
But, it’s ok. 
Leave the missed day in blank, although you will soon find out that it’s annoying to have a unfilled entry. 
Believe me,** it’s takes no time** to write down few lines each day, and **the reward is immense**.

So, **do you still want to have a blurry vision of your past?**
If you decide to implement this table-like diary, make sure to send me a snapshot of your Year in pixels!

PS.: I can share with you my Python notebook to generate the colorful calendar!
